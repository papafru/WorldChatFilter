# Changelog

## 1.1.0-dev — In progress

- Restyle the Statistics panel with the Dark Arcane theme, unified bronze controls, clean counters and in-panel two-step reset confirmation (no chat spam).
- Add a Help / Commands panel with General, Custom Filters and Tools tabs, real supported slash commands and usage tips. `/wcf help` and the existing settings-menu entry now open the panel instead of printing commands in chat.
- Restyle the Custom Filters manager as **Dark Arcane Blizzard**: cohesive slate/bronze buttons and tabs, Dusty Gold highlights, sage/gray filtering status, strong dark backdrop, subtle row stripes, understated Remove buttons, and dual Partial/Whole Word controls. All textures and APIs are Vanilla 1.12 compatible; stored custom filters remain unchanged.
- Redesign Custom Filters as a narrower Blizzard-style window with original Vanilla tabs for Blocked Players / Words & Phrases, one named input, contextual match controls, and an opaque backdrop.
- Use a shared six-row paginated list with clear Remove buttons, per-tab paging, per-tab entry counts, and automatic navigation to freshly added entries; existing saved lists remain intact.
- Fix clipped/missing middle border in the Blocked Words / Phrases input by assigning unique global names to both Vanilla `InputBoxTemplate` edit boxes (required for `$parent` texture anchors).
- Add custom World-only player/word/phrase filters, a paginated native settings panel, case-insensitive partial and whole-word matching, and saved per-character lists.
- Add Block/Unblock from World Chat to the 1.12 chat player's right-click FRIEND popup without invoking Blizzard /ignore. Track custom blocks separately in statistics; the master toggle and World-only channel gate remain authoritative.
- Add `/wcf custom`, `/wcf block player|text|word`, and `/wcf unblock player|text` commands for quick control.
- Add `/wcf toggle` as a single-button macro command: saves the ON/OFF state, prints the status, and refreshes the World color/UI. All category preferences and other chat channels are preserved.
- Development-only changes on `v1.1-dev`, independent from `main` and stable v1.0.1.

## 1.0.1 — 2026-10-13

- Detect direct guild join invitations without the literal word `recruiting` (for example `Join THE CULT, we're a social guild`).
- Default World color is now Dusty Gold (`#D1B77F`); Color Presets submenu opens to the left instead of overlapping the main menu. Existing user-selected colors are retained.
- Reset Color returns to Dusty Gold.
- Detect `LF` immediately followed by a linked enchant/recipe (`LF[Enchant Weapon - Spell Power]`), with or without spaces/counts; support native enchant/spell/item/tradeskill hyperlinks. Keep crafting links under Services rather than Trade and allow normal link discussions.

- Recognize leading `LF` with or without a number plus class/role/spec or dungeon/raid/BG, including Vanilla and Turtle WoW full names/abbreviations (`LF4 RAZORFEN KRAUL`, `LF RFK`).
- Regression tests for optional counts, ordinary chat and World-channel isolation.


## 0.3.23 — Beta (2026-10-12)

- Recognize short `LF + dungeon` ads, including Scarlet Graveyard variants.
- Recognize numbered group needs such as `need 1 heal for ...` with unknown destinations.
- Recognize compact role compositions like `DEADMINES HEAL 2DPS`.
- Add regression tests for these patterns, ordinary chat and World/Trade isolation.
- Keep the color picker, statistics and other features unchanged.

## 1.0.0 — 2026-10-12

Initial stable release based on **v0.3.23**, including the latest contextual LFG fixes.

- World-only contextual detection for trade, group finding, guild recruitment, professions/services, summon/taxi listings, and repeat spam.
- Expanded short-hand LFG detection (e.g., `LF7M`, `LF 1M`, `LF1Healer`, `LF 2 DPS`, and class variants).
- Multilingual and indirect guild recruitment detection without guild-name blacklists.
- Expanded English and Italian guild recruitment patterns, including PvP/PvE communities.
- Scheduled PUG/raid recruitment detection using role/class demand and recurring event context.
- Local per-character statistics, sensitivity settings, minimap button, and diagnostic commands.
- Optional World-only color tint with four presets and a native RGB picker.
- Standalone addon, with no SocialChat dependency.
- Performance improvements to classifier lookups and repeat-history cleanup from earlier betas.

**Known limitations:** Rule-based filtering cannot guarantee zero misses or false positives. The channel must be named `World`. Competing chat and color addons may affect appearance/behavior.
